"""
Obliviate MCP server.

Lets any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) use Obliviate's
verifiable memory as tools: remember facts, recall them (grounded + honest), provably forget a
subject with proof, and inspect the memory. Backed by CockroachDB — the same engine the web app uses.

Run:      python mcp_server.py
Connect:  claude mcp add obliviate -- python /ABS/PATH/obliviate/mcp_server.py
