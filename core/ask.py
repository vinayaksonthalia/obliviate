"""
Ask: answer a question from the agent's memory.

Retrieval is two-stage, both inside CockroachDB:
  1. vector (cosine ANN) recall over nodes to find the most relevant entities,
  2. a recursive CTE that expands the graph around those seeds (connected facts / blast radius).
The serialized context is handed to the LLM with a strict grounding prompt: answer only from the
context, and say plainly when something is not on record — never hallucinate. This honesty is what
makes "forgetting" provable: once a node is deleted, it cannot resurface in an answer.
