"""
Obliviate evaluation harness.

Two measurements, both run live against CockroachDB:

1. Reconstruction-Robustness Score (RRS) — the security claim.
   An attacker holds a leaked/backup copy of a record's ciphertext (as lingers in MVCC history or
   backups) and tries to recover the plaintext after the record is "deleted".
   - Naive delete: rows removed but the encryption key survives -> leaked ciphertext still
     decryptable -> recovered.
   - Obliviate: the forget transaction crypto-shreds the key -> leaked ciphertext is
     cryptographically unrecoverable -> not recovered.
   Mirrors Ghost Vectors (arXiv:2606.18497): API-deletion leaves data ~99% recoverable; key
   destruction drops it to 0%.

2. Forget-correctness — the behavioral claim.
   Ingest several people, hard-forget half, and verify the forgotten people's identifying data no
   longer surfaces in answers while survivors' data still does.
