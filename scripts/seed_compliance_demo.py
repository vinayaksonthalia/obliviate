"""
The compliance demo — the scenario the flat-table competitors structurally cannot handle.

Two customers, Alice and Bob, both employed at the SAME company (Acme Corp) — a *shared*
entity in the knowledge graph. Alice exercises her GDPR Article 17 right to be forgotten.
Obliviate erases Alice's exclusive knowledge (her mortgage, her provenance) AND crypto-shreds
her key, while *provably retaining* Acme Corp for Bob — with the shared node's Alice-provenance
removed. A competitor whose schema is flat per-subject tables cannot express this: it can only
destroy "Alice", with no notion of an entity shared with a surviving subject.

Load it into the 'compliance' workspace:  python scripts/seed_compliance_demo.py
Then in the app, switch to the 'compliance' workspace and Forget & Prove `alice-chen`.
