Seed a rich demo knowledge base into Obliviate (default workspace).

An SRE / incident-response memory: detailed runbooks + post-mortems whose text names many
entities (systems, teams, metrics, failure modes, incidents) so the extracted graph is DENSE
and cross-referenced. Shared entities (the api-gateway edge, the core-platform team, Redis)
mean a Forget & Prove on one subject demonstrates shared-node *retention*.

Review dates are backdated so Curation (aging records, memory-health, the decay cycle) and the
Timeline have real content. Run:  python scripts/seed_demo.py
