"""Self-heal the public demo.

The live demo lets anyone run Forget & Prove (that's the point). This means the seeded
`default` workspace can be emptied — by an honest judge trying the hero flow, or by anyone
malicious. This script rebuilds the demo when it has been wiped, and is a no-op (one cheap
COUNT) when the demo is intact, so it's safe to run on a short cron.

`seed_demo.main()` first clears the workspace's rows *including crypto-shredded subject_keys*,
so subjects that were forgotten (and would otherwise be blocked from re-onboarding with a 409)
come back cleanly.

Cron (every 10 min):
  */10 * * * * cd /home/ubuntu/obliviate && /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/uv run scripts/heal_demo.py >> /home/ubuntu/heal.log 2>&1
